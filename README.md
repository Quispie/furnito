The goal of our web crawler is to access data *quickly*, *efficiently* and as many *useful resources* as possible. As our target site is [overstock](http://www.overstock.com/) — a furniture website, we need to crawl as many furnitures as possible, so the design of crawler is respect to *breath first strategy*. Here is a short description of different modules of our crawler:

1. config module, record all user configurable settings, including `base_url`, `depth`, `data_path` etc.
2. initial module, initial a  classes and libraries we need to use. As we are using python for the whole project, the initial module is written in `__init__.py`.
3. field module, decide for a specific furniture, which field of data do we nedd to crawl. For our case, furniture `name`, `price`, `description`, `reviews` and `origin_link` are the most important properties.
4. crawl module, using *Xpath* extractor to extract useful field for a given furniture url.
5. url manager, manage url, include several functions including `add_url`, `remove_url` and `history_url`. This module is used for interact with module *URL_POOL*.
6. url pool, manage url in a queue data structure, and ensure there is no duplicate url exist.
7. robot module, use to read *Robot.txt* and decide crawl strategy.
8. log module, use to recode error in order to keep crawler robust.

Use `config.py` to config your personal settings, run `start.py` to start crawl. Library dependency: `lxml` and `requests`.

<h2 id='indexing'>Indexing</h2>

The general introduction of how to build an *Inverted Index* can be found [here](http://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html). In **Furnito**, we implemented an simple *inverted index* which contains two parts: first part is *dict* and the second part is a *posting list*. Below I'd like to introduce these two parts separately.

**Dictionary** is a part allow query to quickly access where is the current document storage, this part need to be store in memory. For most cases, **Dictionary** need to be store in *hashtable*, in python, we use *dict*. The data structure of our Dictionary looks like this:

| index | term   |
| ----- | ------ |
| 0     | aero   |
| 1     | bed    |
| ...   | ...    |
| n     | yellow |

As shown in table, we gave each term an *index*, and different terms a sorted alphabetically. In order to avoid memory overload, we done this task by the following steps:

1. collect `term`,  `doc_name` from 1 furniture document, write to temp file.
2. collect the same fileds from the second document and pair-wise merge two list of terms.
3. loop through all other furniture documents and do the same thing.
4. use `defaultdict` of python to reduce data according to term, get result like this: `{term: [doc1, doc3, doc7]}`, where term is the sorted term, list of doc indicates in which documents the current term appears.
5. Construct **Dictionary** by adding a int index, store in memory.
6. Construct **Pooling List** by replace all terms by index defined before, export to local storage.

Finall Inverted Index looks like this:

<h2 i3='vsm'>Vector Space Model</h2>

As user send a query, system map query into term id from *dictionary* and then find doc location from posting list. Since we have user query and doc location, it si feasible for us to use a model to give each document a score and make a ranking. The first model we used is *Vector Space Model*.  According to different level of complexity, we implemented 4 vector space models, including *Simple Vector Space Model*, *TF-IDF Vector Space Model*, *Pivot Length Normalized Vector Space Model* and *BM25/Okapi Vector Space Model*. In the following paragraphs, we'll describe why and how we build different models.

`simple_vector_space_model`: We call it 'simple' because it's just finished a dot-product between user query and doc location. Since we want to increase the weight of *valuable* terms and reduce the weight of *normal* terms, this model need to be improved. 

`tfidf_vector_space_model`: According to different terms and documents, we built a *vector space*. It contains *document frequency*, *term-frequency* for each term and each document. Generally, it's like a data frame and we stored it into a cvs file. Except just multiply user query vector and document vector, we added the term frequency into the data frame, and compute `idf` score according to the document frequency. Then gave the result score. If we consider different documents may have different length, and it is unfair to rank long documents and short documents, model still need to be improved.

`pln_vector_space_model`: inspired by Sing et al [1], we implemented one of the state-of-art model named *pivot length normalization vector space model*. In this model, query vector and idf part was fixed, add another variable `b` (between 0 and 1) to control the length of each document. The performance of pln model will be evaluated in the latter section.

`bm25_vector_space`:  Model *bm 25* was one we learned from another paper from Robertson & Walker[2].  This model add a *TF-Transform* term `k` (from 0 to infinity) and `b` (between 0 and 1) to provide precise ranking result. Also, the performance of bm25 will be evaluated in the later section.
